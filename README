Please note that this is a second alpha release of the fuzz software.
It is not yet in a fully packaged form.  All the software should run
with little effort on Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and 4.3BSD variants of UNIX.
Please see the source code for ptyjig.c for specific system configurations.

If you make changes to the software in which others may be interested,
please send them back to us.  Our eventual goal is to produce a version
with makefiles and ifdef's to configure for many systems.

Feel free to send us commments, suggestions, complaints, and questions.  We'll
do what we can to help.

Directories
-----------
Scripts contains the a set of shell scripts that uses pre-defined test
files (the ones we used in our initial paper).
Doc contains manual pages for them.


Running the Tests
-----------------
To run the test, you must

1. Configure the source programs (edit ptyjig.c for your system).
2. Compile the software (make).
3. Make sure the commands are installed in one of your paths.
4. The "run" command in either of the script directories will execute
   the tests.  You should feel free to make a new script directory to
   customize the scripts for your own system.

Note: run.master contains the programs names to test
